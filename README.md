# tattltell
Tattletell’s objective is to help people make educated career choices with a strong focus on financial literacy by providing a user with accurate salary information on prospect jobs in comparison with the current cost of living in their area. 

Tattltell is an online database I’m currently creating to connect people to a website where they can find information on their company’s pay and benefits while comparing their job title to other salaries in their area with a meter informing them if they will be living comfortably according to their area’s cost of living. The process of building Tattletell has helped me practice my skills in different languages including html, css, javascript and sql.
